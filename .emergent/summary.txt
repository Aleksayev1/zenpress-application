The previous AI engineer focused on deploying the XZenPress application (React frontend, FastAPI backend) to public hosting, primarily Netlify for the frontend and Render.com for the backend. The trajectory was dominated by persistent deployment and configuration challenges, moving from initial   to  issues, and ultimately, persistent MongoDB connection problems and frontend caching/synchronization failures on Netlify. Despite numerous attempts to resolve these, including modifying , creating mock files, adjusting environment variables on Render, and forcing Netlify deploys, the custom domain  remained non-functional due to SSL and synchronization issues. The backend on Render.com did eventually become responsive, but failed to load data from MongoDB, leading to a pivot towards providing a self-contained, in-memory backend solution as a working alternative. The conversation concluded with the user's frustration over the custom domain not working.

<product_requirements>
The XZenPress application (formerly ZenPress/AcuPress) is a mobile-first acupressure and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) app for natural pain relief, immunity, and mental well-being. Key features include detailed acupressure point images, a 60-second timer, favorites, history, and medical disclaimers. It supports a freemium/premium model with multi-language support (English, Portuguese) and regional pricing. Payment features include PIX payments (Binance Pay). UI/UX fixes addressed text cutting, login modal freezing, and non-subscription consultation. The mobile frontend transitioned to a Progressive Web App (PWA) strategy. The primary goal is an international launch, initially targeting Google Play internal testing and general web access on . The immediate problem during this trajectory was resolving critical deployment issues on the custom domain, particularly connecting the frontend to a stable backend and displaying real data.

The application employs a three-tier architecture: a FastAPI backend with MongoDB, and a React web frontend (PWA-enabled).



**Key Files Modified/Created in this Trajectory:**

*   : Initially missing , causing . It was later modified to include  and  was removed for public deployment compatibility. (Message 14, 18, 198, 200)
*   : Modified to import  from a new  module instead of , and later reverted to use environment variables for . (Message 182, 188, 195, 205, 212, 218)
*   : A new file created to mock  functionality, allowing the backend to build without the private dependency for public deployment. (Message 186, 201)
*   : Read to determine  and other secrets. (Message 222)
*   : This file holds  crucial for frontend API calls. It was frequently checked and attempted to be synchronized with the correct backend URL. (Message 44, 84, 315, 317, 471, 473, 486, 488, 492, 496)
*   : The main FastAPI application file. It was simplified in later stages to an in-memory database to ensure the backend could run without external database issues during deployment troubleshooting. (Message 411, 442, 443)
*   : A script to populate the MongoDB with initial data. It was run to address techniques not loading issues. (Message 346, 348)
*   **Netlify DNS Records (External)**: Explicitly configured (or attempted to be) to point  (root and ) to Netlify's IPs, but experienced persistent SSL and synchronization issues. (Message 327, 335, 337, 339, 341)

Immediately before the summary request, the AI engineer was deep into troubleshooting the persistent Internal Server Error (Status 500) on the Render.com deployed backend, specifically for the  and  endpoints. This was occurring even after successfully building the Docker image and installing all Python dependencies. The  endpoint () was functional (Message 409).

The root cause of the 500 error was identified as a **missing  environment variable** on Render.com, which caused the application to default to a non-existent database name () instead of . The  itself was also being scrutinized, and an alternative public MongoDB Atlas URL was provided. The  dependency had been successfully removed/mocked, and the  issue was handled by a temporary mock key in  or by adding it as an environment variable in Render.

The primary goal at this point was to get the backend fully functional so the frontend could retrieve data and stop showing offline data or blank page issues. The  file was radically simplified to use in-memory data ( list) to bypass all MongoDB issues and *guarantee* a working backend API. This simplified backend was successfully deployed to Render.com (Message 448, 449, 451, 455).

However, the frontend on Netlify continued to display a blank page or Category not found despite multiple attempts to force redeploys (Clear cache and deploy) and verify the  in . The Netlify frontend was persistently serving an old JavaScript bundle that still pointed to the deprecated internal backend URL, leading to continuous frustration for the user. The last known attempt was to delete and recreate the Netlify site or to directly use the working Render.com backend URL as the main site URL. The conversation concluded with the user expressing severe dissatisfaction about the custom domain  not working.
