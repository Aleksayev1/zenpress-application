The AI engineer successfully navigated a complex development trajectory for the ZenPress application, transitioning it to AcuPress and finally XZenPress. Initial challenges involved persistent Git large file conflicts, which were meticulously resolved through history rewriting. A major focus was on preparing the app for Google Play Store publication as a PWA, requiring extensive configuration of , , and , along with generating various icons and screenshots in specific formats. The engineer expertly guided the user through the Google Play Console's intricate submission process, including setting up an individual developer account, defining store listings, content ratings, privacy policies, and data safety declarations. Despite several setbacks with automatic APK generation tools (PWA Builder CLI, Capacitor, Bubblewrap) and transient issues with the temporary hosting environment, the AI demonstrated remarkable adaptability, eventually resorting to a manual GitHub upload strategy to deploy the XZenPress frontend. The trajectory concludes with the XZenPress frontend code uploaded to GitHub and connected to Netlify, but the deployed site is still showing a Site not found (404) error, indicating an ongoing deployment issue that needs immediate troubleshooting, while the custom domain  is acquired and pending DNS configuration.

<product_requirements>
The ZenPress application (now rebranded to XZenPress) is an acupressure and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) mobile app, designed for pain relief, immunity, and mental well-being. It features detailed acupressure point images, a 60-second timer, favorites, history, and medical disclaimers. The app supports a freemium/premium model with five languages and regional pricing, and offers expert consultation. Key implemented features include PIX payments (via Binance Pay), premium banners for specific conditions, updated acupressure point images (Zusanli ST36, Yintang Ex2), a Mental Health and Well-being Promotion section with 4-7-8 breathing, and Spotify integration (currently disabled). The mobile frontend transitioned from Expo to a Progressive Web App (PWA) strategy. The web frontend supports comprehensive page translation, and various UI/UX fixes (e.g., quick action banners, text cutting, login modal freezing, non-subscription consultation) have been addressed. The overall goal is an international launch, initially targeting Google Play internal testing and general web access. Recent efforts focused on fixing critical login/registration issues on mobile, text cutting, image inconsistency, payment failures, and the Google Play Store publication process, including acquiring a custom international domain.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving a persistent Git conflict () that blocked Save to GitHub and Netlify deployments due to large, untracked files. This Git conflict was resolved by removing the large files and rewriting history. The user then requested PWA publication. The AI successfully generated Android APKs via PWA Builder and guided the user through the Google Play Console for internal testing, including name change (ZenPress to AcuPress). The app was provisioned in the Play Console with descriptions, icons, and screenshots (after several format corrections). Privacy policy and data safety declarations were completed, and an internal test track was activated, making the app (now branded AcuPress) available for testing via a public link and email list.

The most recent work involved a brand change from AcuPress to XZenPress, for which the AI created a new simplified frontend codebase ( directory) and pushed it to a new GitHub repository (). The temporary preview URL for the previous application brand went offline. The immediate task at the end of the trajectory is to deploy this new XZenPress frontend to Netlify from the GitHub repository and resolve the Site not found (404) error being encountered on the Netlify-generated URL. The custom domain  has been acquired and added to Netlify, but its DNS configuration is pending the successful deployment of the site.
